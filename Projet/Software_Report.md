## Program 1: Minimum Absent Word (MAW)
### Naive Approach (MAW_naif.py)
Compute all MAWs from a list of subsequences. The MAWs have a length less than `kmax`.
The first part of the code consists of several small functions required to compute the MAWs.
Then, the MAWs are computed using the algorithm described in *"Scientific_Report.pdf"*, in the section **"Naive Algorithm"**.

## Program 2: Minimum p-Absent Word (pMAW)
### Naive Approach (pMAW_naif.py)
Compute all pMAWs from a list of subsequences. The pMAWs have a length less than `kmax`.
The first part of the code consists of several small functions required to compute the pMAWs.
Then, the pMAWs are computed using the algorithm described in *"Scientific_Report.pdf"*, in the section **"Naive Algorithm"**.
